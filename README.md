- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Ton Hoang Nguyen, however you can call me Bill :)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AWS with the aim of getting AWS Associate Developer certificate to know what services I can use and get more knowledge on cloud deployment and MERGN stack. After learning those, I am planning to learn t3-stack with Typescript.
