- 👋 Hi, my name is Ton Hoang Nguyen, however you can call me Bill :)
- 🧑‍💻 At the moment, working as a Software Developer Trainee at [Mendix](https://www.teamepoch.net)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AWS with the aim of getting AWS Associate Developer certificate to know what services I can use and get more knowledge on cloud deployment and MERGN stack. After learning those, I am planning to learn t3-stack with Typescript.
 
From college years, I am highly interested in applications that involves Machine Learning and in general AI. I have competed on 2 competitions in the student team called [Epoch](https://www.teamepoch.net). on Zindi and AICrowd which are similar to Kaggle. Due to my curiosity about space, I joined [Lunar Zebro](https://zebro.space) to work on the object detection model for detecting obstacles on the Moon with SHRIMP camera, customed made camera made by students from TUDelft to withstand radiation and extreme temperatures.
